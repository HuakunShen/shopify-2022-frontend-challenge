## Method 1

Run code on host

```bash
npm i @vue/cli
npm i
npm run serve
```

Go to `localhost:8080` in browser.

## Method 2

In case you don't have the same environment as I do, I provide a docker-compose file which should run under most system.

Just run `docker-compose up`

Go to `localhost:8080` in browser.
